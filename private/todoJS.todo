TODO

☐ array with piece moves -- the keys are "rook", ... @timestamp(2018-11-23 16:12)
    ☐ good for a pawn, not so much for anything else, so that I use another method for rooks, queen, bishop -- and
☐ function for highlighting a set of zones @timestamp(2018-11-23 16:12)
☐ general function for moving a piece @timestamp(2018-11-23 16:12)
