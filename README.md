# WEBproj
Playing with HTML/CSS/JavaScript

AS A DISCLAIMER, the beginning of this project I expect to be a mess.
This is also an occasion to set up the right goals for myself. Establish the most important bits-n-pieces when working for larger projects, and when learning to use the languages for those larger projects.

That caveat out of our way,
The project at the first glance is... says that I have to hone everything I learn, so that
* the files I use, and the arborescent structure
* the functions I define
* the names I give to classes, id's, functions
reflect the semantics of the project. But I'm alone on this project. It may not be the case in the future,

so I'm going to write a documentation, sort of, for the APP.


The long way takes short steps, but the resulta are already there, so here I go.


P.S. I'll see that the next README's will be more formal, and on point. Wish me luck.
